This repository illustrates the usage of APIs in Kotlin using the Ktor library in a simplified manner. Additionally, it utilizes the WeatherAPI to fetch weather data.

It provides sample code demonstrating how to send HTTP requests to the WeatherAPI using Ktor, process the response, and utilize the retrieved weather data.

The code showcases fundamental steps such as initializing an HTTP client, sending a GET request to the WeatherAPI with the API token, parsing the JSON response using Kotlin Serialization, and working with the received data, such as outputting the location name.

This repository serves as an easily understandable entry point for developers looking to utilize APIs in Kotlin, particularly leveraging the Ktor library and the WeatherAPI.
